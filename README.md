# the TF2 trade bot!
This is a steam trade bot that trades TF2 items, automatically! Easy to setup, for non-developers!

# Installation
If you have "git" installed, you can just type
```git
git clone https://github.com/Zwork101/tf2_trade_bot.git
``` 
otherwise, just download the zip. Make sure you keep every file in the same folder
# Setup
You will need the language python3.6 or greater. If you don't have python installed, you can find the download [here](https://www.python.org/).
Each file has a description in this repo, to find out what you should do. You can ignore bot.py however, that doesn't need changing :P

# Running 
If you are here, you have added your ID and secrets too steamguard.json, password username and api keys to settings.json, and filled out trade.data with whatever you wanted to sell. You can now run bot.py! You *will* have to install some packages, but the bot will handle that part for you! Just restart the program when it tells you to. If you're having truoble with somthing or you come across an error, make an issue in this repo and I'll respond asap!
